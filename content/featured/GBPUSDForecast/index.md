Neural Networks (DNN, RNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM) were designed and evaluated for GBP/USD forecasting. Python and TensorFlow/Keras were employed, with the process involving temporal feature extraction, data scaling, and Hyperband tuning. The top-performing RNN model, achieving strong metrics, highlights skill in building and optimizing deep learning solutions for real-world financial prediction.
